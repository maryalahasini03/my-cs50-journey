Week 3 — Algorithms Topics Covered

Searching: Linear search vs. optimized binary search
Sorting techniques: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Merge sort
Big O, Ω, Θ notation to express algorithm performance
Basic introduction to recursion and problem-solving paradigms

My Contributions

Implemented multiple searching and sorting algorithms (e.g., linear_search.c, merge_sort.c)
Documented time complexity and use cases for each algorithm
Built simple recursive solutions (e.g., pointer-based searches)
