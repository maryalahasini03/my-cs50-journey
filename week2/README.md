Week 2 â€” Arrays & Strings Topics Covered

Compilation steps: preprocessing, compiling, linking
Data structures: arrays, strings, and \0 (null terminator)
Looping through arrays; efficient use of strlen()
Command-line arguments and basic cryptography (Caesar cipher, substitution ciphers)

My Contributions

Solved array/string-based problem sets such as Caesar cipher
Added clear comments on memory boundaries and string-handling logic
Included sample manual tests to demonstrate correctness
