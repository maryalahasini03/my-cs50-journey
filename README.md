CS50: Introduction to Computer Science — Weeks 1 to 3

Welcome to my CS50 journey! This repository includes my work and notes from Weeks 1 through 3 of Harvard's CS50 course.

Week 1 — C Programming
Topics Covered
- Command-line interface (CLI), compilers, and toolchain basics
- Writing and executing C programs (`hello.c`)
- Core constructs: data types, variables, operators, conditionals, loops
- Debugging with `debug50`, style (`style50`), and correctness (`check50`)

My Contributions
- Implemented basic C programs (e.g., `hello.c`, `mario.c`, `cash.c`)
- Practiced formatting code to meet style expectations
- Annotated and explained common pitfalls like integer overflow and floating-point imprecision

Week 2 — Arrays & Strings
Topics Covered
- Compilation steps: preprocessing, compiling, linking
- Data structures: arrays, strings, and `\0` (null terminator)
- Looping through arrays; efficient use of `strlen()`
- Command-line arguments and basic cryptography (Caesar cipher, substitution ciphers)

My Contributions
- Solved array/string-based problem sets such as Caesar cipher
- Added clear comments on memory boundaries and string-handling logic
- Included sample manual tests to demonstrate correctness

Week 3 — Algorithms
Topics Covered
- Searching: Linear search vs. optimized binary search
- Sorting techniques: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Merge sort
- Big O, Ω, Θ notation to express algorithm performance
- Basic introduction to recursion and problem-solving paradigms

My Contributions
- Implemented multiple searching and sorting algorithms (e.g., `linear_search.c`, `merge_sort.c`)
- Documented time complexity and use cases for each algorithm
- Built simple recursive solutions (e.g., pointer-based searches)
